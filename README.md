# Fraud Detection with SVMSMOTE and Neural Networks

## 📌 Overview  
Fraud detection is a critical challenge in financial and security domains. This project enhances fraud detection by leveraging **SVMSMOTE** for handling class imbalance and a **Neural Network model** to achieve high accuracy in identifying fraudulent transactions.

## 🚀 Features  
- **SVMSMOTE (Support Vector Machine Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** for effective handling of imbalanced data  
- **Neural Network-based classification model** for improved fraud detection  
- Achieved **98.5% accuracy** with optimized preprocessing and feature selection  
- Scalable and adaptable to various fraud detection datasets  

## 📂 Dataset  
- The dataset used consists of **imbalanced financial transactions** with a high number of legitimate transactions and few fraudulent ones.  
- Preprocessing includes **feature scaling, outlier removal, and data balancing** using SVMSMOTE.  

## 🛠 Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn  
- **Techniques:** SVMSMOTE, Neural Networks, Feature Engineering  

## 🔍 Methodology  
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning, scaling, and handling missing values  
2. **Feature Engineering:** Selecting important features for classification  
3. **SVMSMOTE Implementation:** Balancing the dataset  
4. **Neural Network Model:** Training and optimizing for fraud detection  
5. **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score  

## 📊 Results  
- **Accuracy:** 98.5%  
- **Precision & Recall:** High precision with minimal false positives  
- **Model Comparison:** Outperformed traditional models like Logistic Regression and Decision Trees  

## 💡 Future Improvements  
- Testing on **real-time fraud detection** systems  
- Implementing **ensemble learning** for better performance  
- Exploring **Explainable AI (XAI)** for transparency in fraud prediction
